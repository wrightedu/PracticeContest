## Start Up Instructions

1. Click on `PC2-Team` icon - this will load the competition software.  If you close this, you will need to open / run it again
2. Log in:
  - Username: `team#` where # is your team number
  - Password: `team#` where # is your team number
3. Download the competition sample input and output files from https://github.com/wrightedu/PracticeContest
  - Click the green `Code` button, then click `Download as zip`
4. Extract the files to somewhere convenient (Desktop is recommended)
5. No internet access is allowed during the competition.  **If you need to get the files again, summon a judge / room monitor.**

## Competition Sample Run

1. Click on the pc^2 team icon on the desktop.
2. Sign in with **username: team#** and **password: team#**
1. Right now you are logged in to the testing server.  
2. **When the competition starts**, you will close the software and log back in to the competition server.
3. To test your ability to submit your code solutions to the server, your test challenge is the `Parrot` problem - see `Parrot.pdf` to view problem instructions.  Use this problem to **Test** and **Submit** your solution.

### PC^2 - Test
- The "Submit Run" tab contains both **Test** and **Submit**
- Select the language of your source code - Java, C, C++, or Python
- In "Main file", select your **source code** file.
- The Test button will ask for an **input file**.
- `Parrot-Sample` contains a sample input (`.in`) and sample output / answer (`.ans`) file.
  - All contest problems will have sample inputs and outputs to use to test your program and its output
- When you **Test**, select the `001.in` file in the `Parrot-Sample` folder.
- Compare your output to the `001.ans` file

### PC^2 - Submit
- The "Submit Run" tab contains both **Test** and **Submit**
- Select the language of your source code - Java, C, C++, or Python
- In "Main file", select your **source code** file.
- You will await a determination from the judge
  - Determinations are vague to encourage you to use additional test cases.

## 2023 ACM Programming Contest
* Complete as many questions as you can during the contest. 

* All questions require you to read the test data from standard input and write results to standard output; you cannot use any non-contest files for input or output. 

* The input to problems will consist of multiple test cases unless otherwise noted. 

* Programming style is not considered in this contest. You are free to code in whatever style you prefer.  Commenting code is not required. 

* All communication with the judges will be handled by the PC2 environment. 

* Allowed programming languages: C, C++, Java, and Python. 

* **Netbeans users: Remove package statement before you submit** 

* **Java users: remember to call `nextLine()` on a scanner after reading in an integer when needed.**

* All programs will be re-compiled prior to testing with the judges’ data. 

* Output must match the sample format exactly. Do not print prompts unless asked to. 

* Non-standard libraries cannot be used in your solutions. The Standard Template Library (STL) and string libraries are allowed. The standard Java API is available and can be used, except for those packages that are deemed dangerous by contest officials (e.g., that might generate a security violation) 

* Hardcopy reference materials are allowed, but not electronic material. Calculators are fine, but no laptops, phones, USB drives, etc. are allowed.  

* No connection to the Internet may be made during the contest. 

* **Only one computer may be used per team.**

Judges decisions are to be considered final. No cheating will be tolerated. 

See you space cowboy ;)
